The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout behavior.  Specifically, the calculation within `calc()` results in a `NaN` (Not a Number) value due to an invalid operation or incompatible units. This often occurs when attempting to mix percentages, pixels, and other units without proper consideration. For example, trying to subtract a percentage from a pixel value directly will often result in a `NaN`.
